## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Node.js 18+ installed
* Git
* Rust (for Tauri desktop app development)
* A Supabase account (for backend functionality)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/payday.git
   cd payday
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables: Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

### Running the Web Version
Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:8080` to view the application.

### Running the Desktop App (Tauri)
To run the desktop application in development mode:
```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

## Building for Production

### Web Version
To build the web application for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized output will be in the `dist` folder.

### Desktop App
To build the desktop executable:
```bash
npm run tauri build
```

This will create platform-specific binaries in the `src-tauri/target/release` directory.

## Deployment

### Web App
PAYDAY can be deployed to various hosting platforms:

**Netlify/Vercel**  
Simply connect your repository to Netlify or Vercel and configure the build settings.

**Traditional Hosting**  
Upload the contents of the `dist` folder to your web server.

### Desktop App
Distributable installers for Windows, macOS, and Linux are generated when running the Tauri build command. These can be distributed through your preferred channels.
